# Makeup Kit & Beauty Routine Manager

## Overview

This project provides a command-line interface (CLI) system for managing beauty products and beauty routines. The system allows users to manage their beauty products, define beauty routines, and track which products are part of which routines. It includes CRUD operations for all entities (beauty products, beauty routines, and routine-product relationships).

### Problem Statement

Managing beauty products and routines can become disorganized and difficult to track without a proper system. Many beauty enthusiasts rely on manual processes like notebooks or spreadsheets, which can lead to:

- Product duplication
- Inefficient tracking of which products are in which routines
- Difficulty in updating and organizing products and routines

### Solution

This project offers a Makeup Kit & Beauty Routine Manager that:

- Allows users to add, update, view, and delete beauty products
- Enables users to create, modify, and delete beauty routines
- Tracks which beauty products are part of specific routines
- Is designed to be flexible and scalable to accommodate future features (e.g., product expiry dates, ratings)
